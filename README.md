# Android Project
## Description
User friendly Android application for hungry people looking for a good meal.
Search for restaurants wherever and whenever you want, based on location and name.
Ever found yourself forgetting the names of your favourite restaurants?
Not anymore! With the Favourite feature, you can save your favourite restaurants.
Moreover you can have as many local users as you want, all with their own lists, in case your little brother doesn't have a phone, but still wants to use the app.
